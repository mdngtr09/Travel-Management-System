Travel Management System
This project is part of a travel agency's system that manages the registration of travel packages and sales data. Each travel package includes transportation and accommodation details, along with pricing and profit margins.

The system allows users to:
- Register transportation types (air, road, sea, etc.) with their respective values.
- Register accommodation details with a description and daily rates.
- Create travel packages that calculate the total accommodation cost based on the number of days and apply a profit margin and additional fees to the total package value.
- Convert the total price between USD and BRL, using user-provided exchange rates.
- Process sales by recording client data, payment method, and travel packages sold, displaying the total cost in both currencies.

Developed in Java, this project applies core OOP concepts to structure a modular, maintainable solution for travel package and sales management.
